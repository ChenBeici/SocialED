## 📋 Collected Algorithms


The library integrates methods ranging from classic approaches like LDA and BiLSTM to specialized techniques such as KPGNN, QSGNN, FinEvent, and HISEvent. Despite significant advancements in detection methods, deploying these approaches or conducting comprehensive evaluations has remained challenging due to the absence of a unified framework. SocialED addresses this gap by providing a standardized platform for researchers and practitioners in the SED field.

## Implemented Algorithms


- **LDA**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups. It is particularly useful for discovering the hidden thematic structure in large text corpora.
- **BiLSTM**: Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks enhance the capabilities of traditional LSTMs by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions. This bidirectional approach is effective for tasks like sequence classification and time series prediction.
- **Word2Vec**: Word2Vec is a family of models that generate word embeddings by training shallow neural networks to predict the context of words. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, making them useful for various natural language processing tasks.
- **GLOVE**: Global Vectors for Word Representation (GLOVE) generates word embeddings by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus. This approach produces vectors that capture meaning effectively, based on the frequency of word pairs in the training text.
- **WMD**: Word Mover's Distance (WMD) measures the semantic distance between two documents by computing the minimum distance that words from one document need to travel to match words from another document. This method is grounded in the concept of word embeddings.
- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a transformer-based model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. BERT has achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks.
- **SBERT**: Sentence-BERT (SBERT) modifies the BERT network to generate semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine similarity. It is particularly useful for sentence clustering and semantic search.
- **EventX**: EventX is designed for online event detection in social media streams, processing tweets in real-time to identify emerging events by clustering similar content. This framework is optimized for high-speed data environments.
- **CLKD**: cross-lingual knowledge distillation (CLKD) combines a convolutional neural network with dynamic time warping to align sequences and detect events in streaming data. This online algorithm is effective for real-time applications.
- **KPGNN**: Knowledge-Preserving Graph Neural Network (KPGNN) is designed for incremental social event detection. It utilizes rich semantics and structural information in social messages to continuously detect events and extend its knowledge base. KPGNN outperforms baseline models, with potential for future research in event analysis and causal discovery in social data.
- **Finevent**: Fine-Grained Event Detection (FinEvent) uses a reinforced, incremental, and cross-lingual architecture for social event detection. It employs multi-agent reinforcement learning and density-based clustering (DRL-DBSCAN) to improve performance in various detection tasks. Future work will extend RL-guided GNNs for event correlation and evolution.
- **QSGNN**: Quality-Aware Self-Improving Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) improves open set social event detection with a pairwise loss and orthogonal constraint for training. It uses similarity distributions for pseudo labels and a quality-aware strategy to reduce noise, achieving state-of-the-art results in both closed and open set scenarios.
- **ETGNN**: Evidential Temporal-aware Graph Neural Network (ETGNN) enhances social event detection by integrating uncertainty and temporal information using Evidential Deep Learning and Dempster-Shafer theory. It employs a novel temporal-aware GNN aggregator, outperforming other methods.
- **HCRC**: Hybrid Graph Contrastive Learning for Social Event Detection (HCRC) captures comprehensive semantic and structural information from social messages. Using hybrid graph contrastive learning and reinforced incremental clustering, HCRC outperforms baselines across various experimental settings.
- **UCLSED**: Uncertainty-Guided Class Imbalance Learning Framework (UCLSED) enhances model generalization in imbalanced social event detection tasks. It uses an uncertainty-guided contrastive learning loss to handle uncertain classes and combines multi-view architectures with Dempster-Shafer theory for robust uncertainty estimation, achieving superior results.
- **RPLMSED**: Relational Prompt-Based Pre-Trained Language Models for Social Event Detection (RPLMSED) uses pairwise message modeling to address missing and noisy edges in social message graphs. It leverages content and structural information with a clustering constraint to enhance message representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various detection tasks.
- **HISevent**: Structural Entropy-Based Social Event Detection (HISevent) is an unsupervised tool that explores message correlations without the need for labeling or predetermining the number of events. HISevent combines GNN-based methods' advantages with efficient and robust performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results in closed- and open-set settings.
- **ADPSEMEvent**: Adaptive Differential Privacy Social Event Message Event Detection (ADPSEMEvent) is an unsupervised framework that prioritizes privacy while detecting social events. It uses a two-stage approach: first constructing a private message graph using adaptive differential privacy to maximize privacy budget usage, then applying a novel 2-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm for event detection. This method effectively balances privacy protection with data utility in open-world settings.

## 🏗️ Library Design and Implementation

### 🔧 Dependencies and Technology Stack

SocialED is compatible with Python 3.8 and above, and leverages well-established deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers for efficient model training and inference, supporting both CPU and GPU environments. In addition to these core frameworks, SocialED also integrates NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, numerical operations, and machine learning tasks, ensuring versatility and performance across a range of workflows.

### 🔄 Unified API Design

Inspired by the API designs of established frameworks, we developed a unified API for all detection algorithms in SocialED:

1. ``preprocess`` provides a flexible framework for handling various preprocessing tasks, such as graph construction and tokenization
2. ``fit`` trains the detection algorithms on the preprocessed data, adjusting model parameters and generating necessary statistics for predictions
3. ``detection`` uses the trained model to identify events from the input data, returning the detected events
4. ``evaluate`` assesses the performance of the detection results by comparing predictions with ground truth data, providing metrics like precision, recall and F1-score

### 💻 Example Usage

    dataset = Event2012()                                  # Load "Event2012" dataset
    
    from SocialED.detector import KPGNN                    # Import KPGNN model
    kpgnn = KPGNN(dataset, batch_size=200)                # Initialize KPGNN model
    
    kpgnn.preprocess()                                     # Preprocess data
    kpgnn.fit()                                           # Train the model
    pres, trus = kpgnn.detection()                        # Detect events
    
    kpgnn.evaluate(pres, trus)                            # Evaluate detection results
